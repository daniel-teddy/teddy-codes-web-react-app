By adding a button to your website, you can make it easier for customers to shop for items they are interested in and make it more likely that they will complete a purchase. There are a few things to keep in mind when designing an Add to cart button: Make sure the button is visible and easy to find. Consider the colour of the button – it should contrast with the rest of the website so that it stands out. Use an action word like “add” or “buy” so that customers know what the button does. Make sure the button is clickable – it should be large enough and have enough space around it so that it can be clicked easily. Consider the placement of the button – it should be placed near the items it applies to so that customers can easily find it. Add-to-cart buttons are an important criterion of e-commerce websites. If you’re looking to add a “add to cart” button to your HTML, there are a few things you’ll need to do. First, you’ll need to create a button element: Add to Cart Next, you’ll need to add some CSS to style the button. For this example, we’ll make the button green and give it some padding: button{ background-color: green; padding: 10px; } Finally, you’ll need to add an onclick event handler to the button. This will execute a function that will add the item to the cart.  And that’s it!

Backend developers use languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP to create the logic and functionality of a website, such as handling form submissions, querying databases, and processing user input.\",\n  largeDesc: \"Web development is a vast field that encompasses many different aspects of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. One of the most fundamental distinctions in web development is the difference between frontend and backend development. In this blog post, we'll explore the key differences between frontend and backend web development and the roles of each. Frontend development, also known as client-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the user interface and the user experience. Frontend developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements and layout of a website, as well as to add interactivity and dynamic functionality. The frontend developer's main goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that is easy to navigate. Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the functionality and logic of a website or web application. Backend developers use languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP to create the logic and functionality of a website, such as handling form submissions, querying databases, and processing user input. The backend developer's main goal is to create a robust and efficient server-side infrastructure that can handle the demands of the website or web application. In a nutshell, frontend development is focused on how the website or web application looks and feels, while backend development is focused on how it works. The frontend developer's work is focused on the client side and the user experience, while the backend developer's work is focused on the server side and the functionality. It's worth noting that the line between frontend and backend development is becoming increasingly blurred as the technology evolves. With the rise of technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue, frontend developers are now able to do more complex logic on the frontend side, while backend developers are able to do more styling and layout. \",\n  quote: \"The frontend developer's work is focused on the client side and the user experience, while the backend developer's work is focused on the server side and the functionality.

A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript, where programmers can manipulate the functions and use them for their convenience.Frameworks are more adaptable for web design, and hence most website developers take to them. Frameworks make working with JavaScript easier and smoother, offering such possibilities as making applications device responsive. So Which is the Best JavaScript Framework? When it comes to web development, Javascript continues to be the dominant language. But all of the various JavaScript frameworks have their own uses, and advantages and disadvantages. So bear that in mind when thinking about choosing one. Carefully study your project requirements before choosing your framework for your application as every framework comes with unique features that you may require during development. Apart from the features, also consider the learning curve, complexity, compatibility documentation, and community support. What is the Fastest JS Framework? Vue.js is the fastest JS framework available.

For the SMS function, we must have an account on fast2sms from where we will get an API key. This API key is used to send SMS over mobile numbers using your account on fast2sms then We create a sendsms() function which will verify the API key and send SMS. In the driver code area, we read the data from the Excel sheet and check today’s date with any of the birthdays. If there is a match, we call the sendEmail() and sendsms() procedures and even we add the present year to the Excel sheet. Also, we have used ToastNotifier from the win10toast library to show desktop reports once the e-mail and SMS have been sent successfully.

By adding a button to your website, you can make it easier for customers to shop for items they are interested in and make it more likely that they will complete a purchase. There are a few things to keep in mind when designing an Add to cart button: Make sure the button is visible and easy to find. Consider the colour of the button – it should contrast with the rest of the website so that it stands out. Use an action word like “add” or “buy” so that customers know what the button does. Make sure the button is clickable – it should be large enough and have enough space around it so that it can be clicked easily. Consider the placement of the button – it should be placed near the items it applies to so that customers can easily find it. Add-to-cart buttons are an important criterion of e-commerce websites. If you’re looking to add a “add to cart” button to your HTML, there are a few things you’ll need to do. First, you’ll need to create a button element: Add to Cart Next, you’ll need to add some CSS to style the button. For this example, we’ll make the button green and give it some padding: button{ background-color: green; padding: 10px; } Finally, you’ll need to add an onclick event handler to the button. This will execute a function that will add the item to the cart.  And that’s it!

One of the most fundamental distinctions in web development is the difference between frontend and backend development. In this blog post, we'll explore the key differences between frontend and backend web development and the roles of each. Frontend development, also known as client-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the user interface and the user experience. Frontend developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements and layout of a website, as well as to add interactivity and dynamic functionality. The frontend developer's main goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that is easy to navigate. Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the functionality and logic of a website or web application. Backend developers use languages such as Python, Ruby, and PHP to create the logic and functionality of a website, such as handling form submissions, querying databases, and processing user input. The backend developer's main goal is to create a robust and efficient server-side infrastructure that can handle the demands of the website or web application. In a nutshell, frontend development is focused on how the website or web application looks and feels, while backend development is focused on how it works. The frontend developer's work is focused on the client side and the user experience, while the backend developer's work is focused on the server side and the functionality. It's worth noting that the line between frontend and backend development is becoming increasingly blurred as the technology evolves. With the rise of technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue, frontend developers are now able to do more complex logic on the frontend side, while backend developers are able to do more styling and layout. \",\n    quote: \"The frontend developer's work is focused on the client side and the user experience, while the backend developer's work is focused on the server side and the functionality.

PHP, short for Hypertext Preprocessor, is a server-side scripting language that has been widely used for backend development for many years. It is the language behind many popular content management systems, such as WordPress and Drupal. PHP is known for its ease of use, and its ability to easily interact with databases. It also has a large community and a wide range of libraries and frameworks that can be used to speed up development. Node.js, on the other hand, is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side, and it has been gaining popularity in recent years. Node.js is known for its high performance, and its ability to handle a large number of concurrent connections. It also has a large and active community, and it is widely used for building real-time applications such as chat apps and real-time data visualization.\",\n    quote: \"When it comes to choosing between PHP and Node.js, it ultimately comes down to the specific needs of your project.
