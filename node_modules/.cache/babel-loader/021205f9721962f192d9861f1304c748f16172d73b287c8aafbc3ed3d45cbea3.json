Consider the colour of the button – it should contrast with the rest of the website so that it stands out. Use an action word like “add” or “buy” so that customers know what the button does. Make sure the button is clickable – it should be large enough and have enough space around it so that it can be clicked easily.

It is not a complete guide to React but rather a complete introduction. React is defined as a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Letâ€™s start by talking about the two different parts of this definition.\",\n  largeDesc: {\n    FirstlargeDesc: \"Frameworks serve a great purpose, especially for young teams and startups. When working with a framework, many smart design decisions are already made for you, which gives you a clear path to focus on writing good application-level logic. However, frameworks come with some disadvantages. For experienced developers working on large codebases, these disadvantages are sometimes a deal breaker. Frameworks are not flexible, although some claim to be. A framework usually wants you to code everything a certain way. If you try to deviate from that way, the framework usually ends up fighting you about it. Frameworks are also usually large and full of features. If you need to use only a small piece of them, you have to include the whole thing anyway. Admittedly, this point is changing today but it is still not ideal. Some frameworks are going modular, which I think is great, but I am a big fan of the pure Unix philosophy: React follows the Unix philosophy because it is a small library that focuses on just one thing and on doing that thing extremely well. That â€œone thingâ€ is the second part of the Reactâ€™s definition: Building User Interfaces. A User Interface (UI) is anything we put in front of users to have them interact with a machine. UIs are everywhere, from the simple buttons on a microwave to the dashboard of a space shuttle. If the device we are trying to interface can understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe a UI for it. Since Web browsers understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe Web UIs. I like to use the word describe here because that is what we basically do with React. We just tell it what we want! React will then build the actual UI, on our behalf, in the Web browser. Without React or similar libraries, we would need to manually build UIs with native Web APIs and JavaScript and that is not as easy. When you hear the statement that â€œReact is declarativeâ€ this is exactly what it means. We describe UIs with React and tell it what we want (not how to do it). React will take care of the â€œhowâ€ and translate our declarative descriptions (which we write in the React language) to actual UIs in the browser. React shares this simple declarative power with HTML itself, but with React we get to be declarative for HTML UIs that represent dynamic data, not just static data. \",\n    SecondlargeDesc: \"When React was released, there was a lot of buzz about its performance because it introduced the smart idea of a virtual DOM that can be used to reconcile the actual DOM. While Reactâ€™s performance is still one of the most important reasons why it is extremely popular today, I donâ€™t classify it as the â€œbestâ€ thing about it. I think React was a game changer because it created a common language between developers and browsers that allows developers to declaratively describe UIs and manage actions on their state instead of actions on their DOM elements. Itâ€™s simply the language of user interface â€œoutcomesâ€. Instead of coming up with steps to describe actions on interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a â€œfinalâ€ state (like a function). When actions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the UIs in the DOM based on that (and it does that efficiently as weâ€™ll see next). Before React, when we needed to work with a browserâ€™s API, which is known as the DOM API, we avoided traversing the DOM tree as much as possible and there is a reason for that. Any operation on the DOM is done in the same single thread thatâ€™s responsible for everything else thatâ€™s happening in the browser, including reactions to user events like typing, scrolling, resizing, etc. Any expensive operation on the DOM means a slow and janky experience for the user. It is extremely important that your applications do the absolute minimum operations and batch them where possible. React came up with a unique concept to help us do exactly that! When we tell React to render a tree of elements in the browser, it first generates a virtual representation of that tree and keeps it around in memory for later. Then itâ€™ll proceed to perform the DOM operations that will make the tree show up in the browser. When we tell React to update the tree of elements it previously rendered, it generates a new virtual representation of the updated tree. Now React has 2 versions of the tree in memory! To render the updated tree in the browser, React does not discard what has already been rendered. Instead, it will compare the 2 virtual versions of the tree that it has in memory, compute the differences between them, figure out what sub-trees in the main tree need to be updated, and only update these sub-trees in the browser. \",\n    ThirdlargeDesc: \"This process is whatâ€™s known as the tree reconciliation algorithm and it is what makes React a very efficient way to work with a browserâ€™s DOM tree.As youâ€™re probably thinking by now, using React is a lot harder than the simple and familiar native way. What is it that React does so well that is worth giving up the familiar HTML and having to learn a new API to write what can be simply written in HTML? The answer is not about rendering the first HTML view. It is about what we need to do to update any existing view in the DOM. This is the moment when React will potentially blow your mind. If you try to type something in the text box of the native DOM version, you will not be able to. This is very much expected because we are basically throwing away the whole DOM node on every tick and regenerating it. However, if you try to type something in the text box that is rendered with React, you can certainly do so! Although the whole React rendering code is within the ticking timer, React is changing only the content of the pre element and not the whole DOM tree. This is why the text input box was not regenerated and we were able to type in it. This is Reactâ€™s smart diffing algorithm in action. It only updates in the main DOM tree what actually needs to be updated while it keeps everything else the same. This diffing process is possible because of Reactâ€™s virtual DOM representation that it keeps around in memory. No matter how many times the UI views need to be regenerated, React will take to the browser only the needed â€œpartialâ€ updates. Not only is this method a lot more efficient but it also removes a big layer of complexity in the way we think about updating UIs. Having React do all the computations about whether we should or should not update the DOM enables us to focus on thinking about our data (state) and the way to describe a UI for it. In React, we describe UIs using components that are reusable, composable, and stateful.We define small components and then put them together to form bigger ones. All components small or big are reusable, even across different projects. You can think of components as simple functions (in any programming language). We call functions with some input and they give us some output. We can reuse functions as needed and compose bigger functions from smaller ones.\",\n    FourthlargeDesc: \"React components are exactly the same; their input is a set of â€œpropsâ€ and their output is a description of a UI. We can reuse a single component in multiple UIs and components can contain other components. The basic form of a React component is actually a plain-old JavaScript function. Some React components are pure but you can also introduce side effects in a component. For example, a component might change the HTML â€œtitleâ€ of a web page when it gets mounted in the browser or it might scroll the browser view into a certain position. Most importantly, a React component can have a private state to hold data that may change over the lifecycle of the component. This private state is an implicit part of the input that drives the componentâ€™s output and thatâ€™s actually what gives React its name! Why is React named â€œReactâ€ anyway? When the state of a React component (which is part of its input) changes, the UI it represents (its output) changes as well. This change in the description of the UI has to be reflected in the device we are working with. In a browser, we need to update the DOM tree. In a React application we donâ€™t do that manually. React will simply react to the state changes and automatically (and efficiently) update the DOM when needed.\"\n  },\n  quote: \"React is a JavaScript â€œlibraryâ€. It is not exactly a â€œframeworkâ€. It is not a complete solution and you will often need to use more libraries with React to form any solution. React does not assume anything about the other parts in any solution.\",\n  iframeLink: \"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cw7GYf7TdbY\",\n  price: 0\n}, {\n  id: 202314,\n  type: \"Post\",\n  category: \"php\",\n  title: \"Laravel Framework - PHP\",\n  name: \"WebDevLanguage\",\n  image: WebDevBusiness,\n  author: \"Teddy\",\n  authorLink: \"\",\n  date: \"2/12/2022\",\n  description: \"Laravel is a free or open-source PHP web framework that is used by the developer to build web applications.

For this example, we’ll make the button green and give it some padding: button{ background-color: green; padding: 10px; } Finally, you’ll need to add an onclick event handler to the button. This will execute a function that will add the item to the cart.  And that’s it!

Frontend development, also known as client-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the user interface and the user experience. Frontend developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements and layout of a website, as well as to add interactivity and dynamic functionality. The frontend developer's main goal is to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface that is easy to navigate. Backend development, also known as server-side development, refers to the parts of web development that are responsible for the functionality and logic of a website or web application.

Letâ€™s start by talking about the two different parts of this definition.\",\n    largeDesc: {\n      FirstlargeDesc: \"Frameworks serve a great purpose, especially for young teams and startups. When working with a framework, many smart design decisions are already made for you, which gives you a clear path to focus on writing good application-level logic. However, frameworks come with some disadvantages. For experienced developers working on large codebases, these disadvantages are sometimes a deal breaker. Frameworks are not flexible, although some claim to be. A framework usually wants you to code everything a certain way. If you try to deviate from that way, the framework usually ends up fighting you about it. Frameworks are also usually large and full of features. If you need to use only a small piece of them, you have to include the whole thing anyway. Admittedly, this point is changing today but it is still not ideal. Some frameworks are going modular, which I think is great, but I am a big fan of the pure Unix philosophy: React follows the Unix philosophy because it is a small library that focuses on just one thing and on doing that thing extremely well. That â€œone thingâ€ is the second part of the Reactâ€™s definition: Building User Interfaces. A User Interface (UI) is anything we put in front of users to have them interact with a machine. UIs are everywhere, from the simple buttons on a microwave to the dashboard of a space shuttle. If the device we are trying to interface can understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe a UI for it. Since Web browsers understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe Web UIs. I like to use the word describe here because that is what we basically do with React. We just tell it what we want! React will then build the actual UI, on our behalf, in the Web browser. Without React or similar libraries, we would need to manually build UIs with native Web APIs and JavaScript and that is not as easy. When you hear the statement that â€œReact is declarativeâ€ this is exactly what it means. We describe UIs with React and tell it what we want (not how to do it). React will take care of the â€œhowâ€ and translate our declarative descriptions (which we write in the React language) to actual UIs in the browser. React shares this simple declarative power with HTML itself, but with React we get to be declarative for HTML UIs that represent dynamic data, not just static data. \",\n      SecondlargeDesc: \"When React was released, there was a lot of buzz about its performance because it introduced the smart idea of a virtual DOM that can be used to reconcile the actual DOM. While Reactâ€™s performance is still one of the most important reasons why it is extremely popular today, I donâ€™t classify it as the â€œbestâ€ thing about it. I think React was a game changer because it created a common language between developers and browsers that allows developers to declaratively describe UIs and manage actions on their state instead of actions on their DOM elements. Itâ€™s simply the language of user interface â€œoutcomesâ€. Instead of coming up with steps to describe actions on interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a â€œfinalâ€ state (like a function). When actions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the UIs in the DOM based on that (and it does that efficiently as weâ€™ll see next). Before React, when we needed to work with a browserâ€™s API, which is known as the DOM API, we avoided traversing the DOM tree as much as possible and there is a reason for that. Any operation on the DOM is done in the same single thread thatâ€™s responsible for everything else thatâ€™s happening in the browser, including reactions to user events like typing, scrolling, resizing, etc. Any expensive operation on the DOM means a slow and janky experience for the user. It is extremely important that your applications do the absolute minimum operations and batch them where possible. React came up with a unique concept to help us do exactly that! When we tell React to render a tree of elements in the browser, it first generates a virtual representation of that tree and keeps it around in memory for later. Then itâ€™ll proceed to perform the DOM operations that will make the tree show up in the browser. When we tell React to update the tree of elements it previously rendered, it generates a new virtual representation of the updated tree. Now React has 2 versions of the tree in memory! To render the updated tree in the browser, React does not discard what has already been rendered. Instead, it will compare the 2 virtual versions of the tree that it has in memory, compute the differences between them, figure out what sub-trees in the main tree need to be updated, and only update these sub-trees in the browser. \",\n      ThirdlargeDesc: \"This process is whatâ€™s known as the tree reconciliation algorithm and it is what makes React a very efficient way to work with a browserâ€™s DOM tree.As youâ€™re probably thinking by now, using React is a lot harder than the simple and familiar native way. What is it that React does so well that is worth giving up the familiar HTML and having to learn a new API to write what can be simply written in HTML? The answer is not about rendering the first HTML view. It is about what we need to do to update any existing view in the DOM. This is the moment when React will potentially blow your mind. If you try to type something in the text box of the native DOM version, you will not be able to. This is very much expected because we are basically throwing away the whole DOM node on every tick and regenerating it. However, if you try to type something in the text box that is rendered with React, you can certainly do so! Although the whole React rendering code is within the ticking timer, React is changing only the content of the pre element and not the whole DOM tree. This is why the text input box was not regenerated and we were able to type in it. This is Reactâ€™s smart diffing algorithm in action. It only updates in the main DOM tree what actually needs to be updated while it keeps everything else the same. This diffing process is possible because of Reactâ€™s virtual DOM representation that it keeps around in memory. No matter how many times the UI views need to be regenerated, React will take to the browser only the needed â€œpartialâ€ updates. Not only is this method a lot more efficient but it also removes a big layer of complexity in the way we think about updating UIs. Having React do all the computations about whether we should or should not update the DOM enables us to focus on thinking about our data (state) and the way to describe a UI for it. In React, we describe UIs using components that are reusable, composable, and stateful.We define small components and then put them together to form bigger ones. All components small or big are reusable, even across different projects. You can think of components as simple functions (in any programming language). We call functions with some input and they give us some output. We can reuse functions as needed and compose bigger functions from smaller ones.\",\n      FourthlargeDesc: \"React components are exactly the same; their input is a set of â€œpropsâ€ and their output is a description of a UI. We can reuse a single component in multiple UIs and components can contain other components. The basic form of a React component is actually a plain-old JavaScript function. Some React components are pure but you can also introduce side effects in a component. For example, a component might change the HTML â€œtitleâ€ of a web page when it gets mounted in the browser or it might scroll the browser view into a certain position. Most importantly, a React component can have a private state to hold data that may change over the lifecycle of the component. This private state is an implicit part of the input that drives the componentâ€™s output and thatâ€™s actually what gives React its name! Why is React named â€œReactâ€ anyway? When the state of a React component (which is part of its input) changes, the UI it represents (its output) changes as well. This change in the description of the UI has to be reflected in the device we are working with. In a browser, we need to update the DOM tree. In a React application we donâ€™t do that manually. React will simply react to the state changes and automatically (and efficiently) update the DOM when needed.\",\n    },\n    quote: \"React is a JavaScript â€œlibraryâ€. It is not exactly a â€œframeworkâ€. It is not a complete solution and you will often need to use more libraries with React to form any solution.
